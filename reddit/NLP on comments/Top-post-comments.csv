But the Palestinians were among the most welcoming and friendly people I have met across the world...even after finding out we are American they continued to make us feel welcome. I went to the final testing place of Yassir Arafat and left in tears...most of the people in the US don't know the truth about how he died. I was disgusted with my country before, and after that (and the subsequent 4 years of politics) I wanted to denounce it and become Canadian. Or Mexican. Or any country that would take me.
